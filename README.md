Additional alternative firmware options for some devices with TLSR825x can be found at [github.com/slacky1965](https://github.com/slacky1965?tab=repositories), [romasku/tuya-zigbee-switch](https://github.com/romasku/tuya-zigbee-switch), [doctor64/tuyaZigbee](https://github.com/doctor64/tuyaZigbee)

Please direct questions regarding use and configuration in [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/), [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to the appropriate resources.

### Warning(!)

New versions check that the configuration written to the device is compatible with the one updated for the new SDK (i.e. compatible with version 0.1.2.5). If it is not compatible, all settings, including bindings, are deleted. In this case, the Zigbee coordinator sees a device with the same IEEE number and a "rebinding" is performed.

* Due to high consumption, limited transmit power of +2 dBm is used. A moderately discharged CR2032 battery cannot withstand higher power.
* [Average consumption](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc/issues/37#issuecomment-1937844181) for Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC HW: B1.4 - ~15 uA.

## To flash the Zigbee from BLE firmware, use a Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Opera Browser.*

1. Go to the [Over-the-air Webupdater Page TelinkMiFlasher.html](https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/TelinkMiFlasher.html)
2. If using Android, Windows, Linux: Ensure you enabled "experimental web platform features". Therefore copy the according link (i.e. chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features for Chrome), open a new browser tab, paste the copied URL. Now sten the _Experimental Web Platform features_ flag to _Enabled_. Then restart the browser.
3. In the Telink Flasher Page: Press `Connect:`. The browser should open a popup with visible Bluetooth devices. Choose the according target device (i.e. LYWSD03MMC) to pair.
4. After connection is established a _Do Acivation_ button appears. Press this button to start the decryption key process. For original firmware versions 2.1.1_0159 and higher, further description [is provided separately](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/issues/602).
5. Install the BLE firmware. When finished, use "Reconnect".
6. Select and install Zigbee firmware.
7. The device should now show up in your Zigbee bridge (If joining is enabled, of course). If this does not happen, reinsert the battery and/or short-circuit the RESET and GND pins on the LYWSD03MMC board, and on sensors with a button, press the button and hold it for 15 seconds.

## Action of the button

Action of the button (or contact "reset" to "gnd" for LYWSD03MMC):

* Short press - send temperature, humidity and battery data.
* Hold for 2 seconds - Switches temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The change will immediately appear on the screen.
* Hold for 7 seconds — reset binding. The screen will display "ooo" (for devices with fast screen refresh, not E-Ink). After restarting, the thermometer will wait forever for registration. Twitching the battery does not change anything.
* Hold for 15 seconds - resets bindings and all user settings. The screen will no longer display "ooo" and will display temperature and humidity. After restarting, the thermometer will wait forever for registration. Jerking the battery does not change anything.

* After flashing from BLE, the thermometer is already in standby mode for registration in the Zigbee network.

* (!) When changing (Zigbee OTA) the firmware version, if there were changes in the FW functionality, re-registration of the device is required (actual for any Zigbee device).

## Zigbee OTA

[OTA update in ZHA](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc/issues/7)

Before flashing the firmware, check the compliance of the “Manufacturer Code” and “Image Type” between the OTA file and those issued by the Zigbee device.

Sample: "1141-020a-01233001-Z03MMC.zigbee"

## Display decimal places for temperature, humidity and battery charge in ZHA.

[ZHA patch for more precision display of data for all Zigbee devices.](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc/issues/6)

## Indication on LCD screen

A solid "BT" icon indicates a connection loss or the thermometer is not registered with the Zigbee network.

The flashing "BT" icon is called by the "identify" command.

## Current additions

1. Added project assembly using 'make' (Windows/linux) and the ability to import 'Existing Project' into "[Telink IoT Studio](http://wiki.telink-semi.cn/wiki/IDE-and-Tools/Telink_IoT_Studio/ )".

2. Default intervals for temperature and humidity reporting are set to 30-180 (min-max) seconds, reportableChanged to 0.1C and 0.5%.

3. Consumption has been optimized when the coordinator is disconnected or connection is lost. When performing _rejoin_, if the connection is broken, the thermometer consumes quite a lot. Monitor the work of your network coordinator - Zigbee does not like (almost cannot tolerate) coordinator outages.

4. Consumption has been optimized when polling the reset button or contact.

5. Additional adjustments to consumption consumption and correction of the report transmission functions algorithm.

6. Correspondence of transmitted and displayed measurements (correct rounding).

7. Reducing firmware size: removing unnecessary code from SDK, reorganization of battery voltage measurement (ADC), ...

8. Averaging battery level measurements (eliminates clutter on charts)

9. Switch temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit

10. Adding button actions (ver 0.1.1.1)

11. Added Poll Control Cluster (ver 0.1.1.2)

12. Ver 0.1.1.4: According to the "ZigBee Cluster Library Specification" the "Thermostat Temperature Conversion" values have been corrected. Added On/Off smiley.  (ClusterID: 0x0204 (Thermostat User Interface Configuration), Attr: 0x0000 (TemperatureDisplayMode), ENUM8 = 0 in C, = 1 in F, Attr: 0x0002 (ScheduleProgrammingVisibility), ENUM8 = 0 show smiley On,  = 1 show smiley Off)

13. Ver 0.1.1.5: Description of the HVAC cluster ([for ZHA](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc/issues/28))

13. Ver 0.1.1.6: Setting offsets for temperature and humidity.

14. Ver 0.1.1.7: Add Comfort parameters

15. Ver 0.1.1.8: Easy version. Options disabled: "Groups", "TouchLink", "Find and Bind".

16. Ver 0.1.1.9: Fix configuration saving error

17. Ver 0.1.2.0: At the [request](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc/pull/50#issuecomment-1925906616) of @devbis, for differences in z2m, the device names have been renamed. "-z" will be added to the name Zigbee devices, "-bz" will be added to the [BLE and Zigbee](https://github.com/pvvx/BZdevice) devices, "-zb" to the [Zigbee2BLE](https://github.com/pvvx/Zigbee2BLE) devices.

18. Ver 0.1.2.1: Disabled POLL_CTRL - some programs set a [short polling period](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/zha/core/cluster_handlers/general.py#L603) without taking into account the Zigbee 3.0 specification, which increases consumption. For temperature and humidity offsets, as well as COMFORT parameters, the resolution has been changed to 0.01 units. Added parameters: display off, sensor measurement interval. The ability to change the device name is enabled - works with all programs that support ZigBee 3.0 without rewriting configurations. Down with identifying a device by name in Z2M! Users should be able to change the names of Zigbee devices!

19. Ver 0.1.2.2: Offset correction for SHTv3 and SHT4x sensors.

20. Ver 0.1.2.3: Added the ability to change the "manufacturer name". Changing the structure of saving the model and the manufacturer name. Corrected manufacturer name "MiaoMiaoCe" for MHO-C122 and MHO-C401N.

21. Added firmware for [TH03](https://pvvx.github.io/TS0201_TZ3000_TH03).

22. Added firmware for [LKTMZL02](https://pvvx.github.io/LKTMZL02).

23. Added firmware for [MHO-C401(old)](https://pvvx.github.io/MHO_C401).

24. Ver 0.1.2.4. Added firmware for [ZY-ZTH02](https://pvvx.github.io/ZY-ZTH02), [ZG-227Z](https://pvvx.github.io/ZG-227Z). Prevent ZHA from incorrectly setting LongPoll to a short interval contrary to Zigbee 3.0 standards.

25. Ver 0.1.2.5. Completely reworked version on SDK v3.7.1.2. Merging with [ZBdevice](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc/blob/master/ZBdevices.md). Reduced battery consumption for thermometers with SHTC3 sensor. Changes to storage area for user settings. Additions to button functions. Multiple fixes. Adding new devices. ...

26. Ver 0.1.2.6. Fix - In some cases the 2 timers did not turn off, which led to increased battery consumption. Changes in PollControl. Added [MJWSD06MMC](https://pvvx.github.io/MJWSD06MMC).

27. Ver 0.1.2.7. Fix "1" MHO-C401N, added irq_restore() in sensors SHT4X/SHTC3/SHT30/CHT832x. Limitation "Measurement interval" from 3 to 30 seconds. 

28. Ver 0.1.2.8. Changed LongPollControl (ZHA) setting control algorithm and measurement interval (limit 3..30 seconds). For MHO-C401N added E-Ink refresh after 1024 display updates.

29. Ver 0.1.2.9. Added new version LYWSD03MMC HW:B1.6 (custom name B1.1). Added [ZG-303Z](https://pvvx.github.io/ZG-303Z).

30. Beta Ver 0.1.3.0. Added [Zbeacon-TH01](https://pvvx.github.io/Zbeacon-TH01). Display auto-detection update for LYWSD03MMC B1.6.
